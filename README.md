Obstacle Avoiding Robot with Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic Sensor, and I2C LCD Display
Overview:
This project involves building an obstacle-avoiding robot using an Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensors, DC motors, and an I2C LCD display. The robot is designed to detect obstacles in its path and autonomously navigate around them. It uses ultrasonic sensors to measure the distance to obstacles and finds the longest clear path to move forward. The robot is powered by two 200 RPM DC motors that provide adequate speed and torque for navigation. Additionally, the robot's "thoughts" and decisions are displayed on an I2C LCD screen.

Features:
1)Obstacle Detection: The robot can detect obstacles in its path using ultrasonic sensors.
2)Path Finding: It calculates the longest distance in front of it to find the clearest path.
3)Autonomous Navigation: The robot can navigate around obstacles without human intervention.
4)Visual Feedback: The robot's decisions and status are displayed on an I2C LCD screen.
5)Speed and Maneuverability: Powered by 200 RPM DC motors, the robot balances speed and control.
Components:
1.Arduino Uno: The microcontroller that forms the brain of the robot.
2.Ultrasonic Sensor: Used to detect obstacles by measuring the distance to them.
3.I2C LCD Display: Displays the robot's thoughts, decisions, and status.
4.200 RPM DC Motors: Provide movement to the robot.
5.Motor Driver: Controls the speed and direction of the DC motors.
6.Chassis: The frame that holds all the components together.
7.Wheels: Attached to the motors to move the robot.
8.Power Supply: Batteries to power the Arduino and motors.
